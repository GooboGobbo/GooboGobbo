# 👨‍💻 My Coding Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! Here, you'll find a selection of projects that showcase my skills in coding, data analysis, and web development. I’m passionate about turning raw data into meaningful insights and creating interactive applications. Below are my key projects.


### Notable Projects

- 🏅 **[2008 Olympic Medalists - Tidy Data Project](https://github.com/GooboGobbo/TidyData-Project)**  
  In this project, I cleaned and visualized the 2008 Olympic medalist dataset using **tidy data principles**. I used **pandas** to restructure the dataset with the `melt()` function, split event names to extract gender and event details, and created pivot tables to show medal counts by event and gender. The project is fully interactive with **Streamlit**, where users can explore medalists, events, and gender-based medal counts. This project complements my overall coding portfolio by demonstrating my ability to work with raw data, apply data-cleaning techniques, and build interactive applications.

### Skills
- **Programming Languages**: Python (Intermediate) 
- **Technologies & Tools**: Pandas, Streamlit, PowerBI (Beginner), Excel (Intermediate), Argus (Beginner)  
- **Other**: Data visualization, Data cleaning, Financial modeling

### Goals
I aim to expand my skills in data analysis, visualization, and web development while exploring how technology can be applied to finance and commercial real estate investment.
