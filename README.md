# Hi there, I'm James Edge - aka [GooboGobbo][website] 👋

<img src="https://github.com/GooboGobbo/GooboGobbo/blob/main/Headshot%20Best%201%20(1).png" width="200"/>

I'm a student-athlete at the University of Notre Dame studying Finance. I enjoy watching NBA, playing video games, and learning languages.  
Fun fact: I am pursuing a career in commercial real estate investment.

### Notable Projects

- 🏅 **[2008 Olympic Medalists - Tidy Data Project](link_to_your_tidying_data_project_repo)**  
  In this project, I cleaned and visualized the 2008 Olympic medalist dataset using **tidy data principles**. I used **pandas** to restructure the dataset with the `melt()` function, split event names to extract gender and event details, and created pivot tables to show medal counts by event and gender. The project is fully interactive with **Streamlit**, where users can explore medalists, events, and gender-based medal counts. This project complements my overall coding portfolio by demonstrating my ability to work with raw data, apply data-cleaning techniques, and build interactive applications.

### Skills
- **Programming Languages**: Python (Intermediate), SQL, JavaScript  
- **Technologies & Tools**: Pandas, Streamlit, PowerBI (Beginner), Excel (Intermediate), Argus (Beginner)  
- **Other**: Data visualization, Data cleaning, Web development, Financial modeling

### Goals
I aim to expand my skills in data analysis, visualization, and web development while exploring how technology can be applied to finance and commercial real estate investment.
